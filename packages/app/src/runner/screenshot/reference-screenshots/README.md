These screenshots are checked into git as a good reference for what the output of the tests in screenshot.cy.tsx should be. The screenshots actually generated from each run are also added to Percy, but it is sometimes useful to have easy access to compare known "good" screenshots with the real generated screenshots when developing locally.

That said, since these are manually maintained, they could easily become out of sync with the test over time. So this folder is a convenience, not a absolute source of truth.
